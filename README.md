Resume Screening with Python
Overview
This project is designed to automate the resume screening process using Python. The main objective is to classify resumes into predefined job categories based on their content, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

Features
Resume Parsing: Processes and cleans resumes to extract relevant information.
Text Processing: Implements techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction from resumes.
Model Training: Trains a machine learning classifier to categorize resumes into various job roles.
Prediction: Predicts the job category of a given resume using the trained model.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
nltk
pickle
Files
Resume Screening with Python.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code for resume screening.
clf.pkl: Pre-trained machine learning classifier.
tfidfd.pkl: TF-IDF vectorizer used for feature extraction.
sample_resume.txt: A sample resume file for testing.
How to Run
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have all the required Python libraries installed. 
Open the Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the Resume Screening with Python.ipynb file.
Run the Notebook: Execute the cells in the notebook to load the model, process the resume, and predict its job category.
Test with a Sample Resume: Replace myresume with the content of any resume you wish to categorize.
